/**
 * Describes the main memory policy of {@link PepperJob}s. More specific, it
 * determines the way of loading and storing {@link SDocumentGraph} objects
 * during the processing. The behavior of the {@link DocumentBus} is described
 * as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link MEMORY_POLICY#THRIFTY} - each time, a {@link PepperModule} is
 * setting a {@link SDocument} to {@link DOCUMENT_STATUS#COMPLETED} and no other
 * {@link PepperModule} is currently working on it, it will be send to sleep.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@link MEMORY_POLICY#MODERATE} - each time, a {@link PepperModule} is
 * setting a {@link SDocument} to {@link DOCUMENT_STATUS#COMPLETED}, no other
 * {@link PepperModule} is currently working on it and no other
 * {@link PepperModule} is waiting on it, it will be send to sleep.</li>
 * <li>{@link MEMORY_POLICY#GREEDY} - A {@link SDocumentGraph} will never be
 * send to sleep. In case of the number of maximal processed documents is
 * limited, and was reached, no further {@link SDocumentGraph}s will be imported
 * until one was finished somehow.</li>
 * </ul>
