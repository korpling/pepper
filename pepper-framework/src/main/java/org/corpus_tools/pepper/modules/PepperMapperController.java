 * The interface {@link PepperMapperController} is a communicator class between
 * a {@link PepperModule} and a {@link PepperMapper} object. The aim of this
 * class is to provide some fields, which can be set by the {@link PepperMapper}
 * and be read by the {@link PepperModule} object. It does not contain any
 * reference to the {@link PepperMapper} object. This mechanism is used, to make
 * sure that in case of a forgotten clean up, the {@link PepperMapper} object
 * can be removed by the java garbage collector and does not overfill the main
 * memory.
