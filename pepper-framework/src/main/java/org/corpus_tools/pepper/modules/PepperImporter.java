/**
 * <p>
 * A mapping task in the Pepper workflow is not a monolithic block. It consists
 * of several smaller steps.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Declare the fingerprint of the module. This is part of the constructor.
 * </li>
 * <li>Check readyness of the module.</li>
 * <li>Analyze whether the files in the passed corpus path is importable by this
 * importer.</li>
 * <li>Import the corpus structure.</li>
 * <li>Import the document structure and create a mapper for each corpus and
 * document.</li>
 * <li>clean-up</li>
 * </ul>
 * The following describes the single steps in short. To get a more detailed
 * explanation, take a look to the documentations found at
 * <a href="http://u.hu-berlin.de/saltnpepper" >http://u.hu-berlin.de/
 * saltnpepper</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Declare the fingerprint</h3> Initialize the module and set the modules
 * name, its description and the format description of data which are
 * importable. This is part of the constructor:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public MyModule() {
 * 	super(&quot;Name of the module&quot;);
 * 	setSupplierContact(URI.createURI(&quot;Contact address of the module's supplier&quot;));
 * 	setSupplierHomepage(URI.createURI(&quot;homepage of the module&quot;));
 * 	setDesc(&quot;A short description of what is the intention of this module, for instance which formats are importable. &quot;);
 * 	this.addSupportedFormat(&quot;The name of a format which is importable e.g. txt&quot;,
 * 			&quot;The version corresponding to the format name&quot;, null);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Check readyness of the module</h3> This method is invoked by the Pepper
 * framework before the mapping process is started. This method must return
 * true, otherwise, this Pepper module could not be used in a Pepper workflow.
 * At this point problems which prevent the module from being used you can
 * report all problems to the user, for instance a database connection could not
 * be established.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public boolean isReadyToStart() {
 * 	return (true);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Analyze data</h3> Depending on the formats you want to support with your
 * importer the detection can be very different. In the simplest case, it only
 * is necessary, to search through the files at the given location (or to
 * recursively traverse through directories, in case the location points to a
 * directory), and to read their header section. For instance some formats like
 * the xml formats PAULA (see: http:// www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/en/paula.html )
 * or TEI (see: http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/). The method should return a
 * value between 0 and 1, where 0 means not importable and 1 means definitely
 * importable. If null is returned, Pepper interprets this as unknown and will
 * never suggest this module to the user.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public Double isImportable(URI corpusPath) {
 * 	return null;
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Import corpus structure</h3> The classes {@link PepperImporterImpl} and
 * {@link PepperExporterImpl} provide an automatic mechanism to im- or export
 * the corpus-structure. This mechanism is adaptable step by step, according to
 * your specific purpose. Since many formats do not care about the
 * corpus-structure and they only encode the document-structure, the
 * corpus-structure is simultaneous to the file structure of a corpus. Pepper's
 * default mapping maps the root-folder to a root-corpus ({@link SCorpus}
 * object). A sub-folder then corresponds to a sub-corpus ({@link SCorpus}
 * object). The relation between super- and sub-corpus, is represented as a
 * {@link SCorpusRelation} object. Following the assumption, that files contain
 * the document-structure, there is one {@link SDocument} corresponding to each
 * file in a sub-folder. The {@link SCorpus} and the {@link SDocument} objects
 * are linked with a {@link SCorpusDocumentRelation}.<br/>
 * For keeping the correspondance between the corpus-structure and the file
 * structure, both the im- and the exporter make use of a map, which can be
 * accessed via {@link #getIdentifier2ResourceTable()}. <br/>
 * To adapt the behavior, you can set the file endings in the constructor as
 * follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * this.getDocumentEndings().add(&quot;file ending&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * You can also add the value {@link PepperModule#ENDING_LEAF_FOLDER} to import
 * not files but leaf folders as {@link SDocument} objects. Another possibility
 * is to add the value {@link PepperModule#ENDING_ALL_FILES} to import all files
 * no matter their ending.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Import the document structure</h3> In the method
 * {@link #createPepperMapper(Identifier)} a {@link PepperMapper} object needs
 * to be initialized and returned. The {@link PepperMapper} is the major part
 * major part doing the mapping. It provides the methods
 * {@link PepperMapper#mapSCorpus()} to handle the mapping of a single
 * {@link SCorpus} object and {@link PepperMapper#mapSDocument()} to handle a
 * single {@link SDocument} object. Both methods are invoked by the Pepper
 * framework. To set the {@link PepperMapper#getResourceURI()}, which offers the
 * mapper the file or folder of the current {@link SCorpus} or {@link SDocument}
 * object, this filed needs to be set in the
 * {@link #createPepperMapper(Identifier)} method. The following snippet shows a
 * dummy of that method:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public PepperMapper createPepperMapper(Identifier sElementId) {
 * 	PepperMapper mapper = new PepperMapperImpl() {
 * 		&#064;Override
 * 		public DOCUMENT_STATUS mapSCorpus() {
 * 			// handling the mapping of a single corpus
 * 
 * 			// accessing the current file or folder
 * 			getResourceURI();
 * 
 * 			// returning, that the corpus was mapped successfully
 * 			return (DOCUMENT_STATUS.COMPLETED);
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		&#064;Override
 * 		public DOCUMENT_STATUS mapSDocument() {
 * 			// handling the mapping of a single document
 * 
 * 			// accessing the current file or folder
 * 			getResourceURI();
 * 
 * 			// returning, that the document was mapped successfully
 * 			return (DOCUMENT_STATUS.COMPLETED);
 * 		}
 * 	};
 * 	// pass current file or folder to mapper. When using
 * 	// PepperImporter.importCorpusStructure or
 * 	// PepperExporter.exportCorpusStructure, the mapping between file or
 * 	// folder
 * 	// and SCorpus or SDocument was stored here
 * 	mapper.setResourceURI(getIdentifier2ResourceTable().get(sElementId));
 * 	return (mapper);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>clean-up</h3> Sometimes it might be necessary to clean up after the
 * module did the job. For instance when writing an im- or an exporter it might
 * be necessary to close file streams, a db connection etc. Therefore, after the
 * processing is done, the Pepper framework calls the method described in the
 * following snippet:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public void end() {
 * 	super.end();
 * 	// do some clean up like closing of streams etc.
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
