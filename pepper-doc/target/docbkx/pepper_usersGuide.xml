                - need to register all plugins
                - need to register some config files
                - what else?
                - Pepper provides a predifined folder structure:
                - PEPPER_HOME/conf	--> all config files
                - PEPPER_HOME/plugins	--> all plugins
                - folder does not have to image that structure, you can also customize it by adopting the configs (pepper.properties), but when using that structure, you do not have to change anything
                - Pepper assumes to find the pepper home folder by an environament variable (PEPPER_HOME), or a system property (pepper.home)
                - conf file:
                - if you don't want to make pathes absolute, you can use the variable $PEPPER_HOME, which will be replaced by the detected pepper home location. Now you can make pathes relative to
                the pepper home loctation, by adding a relative path after the string '$PEPPER_HOME' for instance imagine the pepper home location is located in /home/pepper/, and your plugins are located in /home/pepper/plugins,
                you can adopt the plugin property, by the following change in the config file:
                .plugins= $PEPPER_HOME/plugins
                This property will be automatically resolved to /home/pepper/plugins.
